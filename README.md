# Project: 0x1B C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Project containing severall programs using sorting algorithms in C

Concepts:

    At least four different sorting algorithms
    What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
    How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
    What is a stable sorting algorithm


Describing each program:

0-bubble_sort.c is a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm.

    You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements

0-O the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, 1 notation per line:

    in the best case
    in the average case
    in the worst case

1-insertion_sort_list.c is a function that sorts a double linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm.

    You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
    You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements

1-O the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, 1 notation per line:

    in the best case
    in the average case
    in the worst case

2-selection_sort.c is a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm.

    You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements

2-O the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, 1 notation per line:

    in the best case
    in the average case
    in the worst case

3-quick_sort.c is a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm.

    You must implement the Lomuto partition scheme.
    The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.
    You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements

3-O the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, 1 notation per line:

    in the best case
    in the average case
    in the worst case
